\chapter{The Project and the project goals}
\section{The problem}
Two urgent global concerns are environmental sustainability and climate
change; because of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions,
transportation, especially urban commuting, contributes to worsening
those issues.
\section{The goal}

We want to dynamically modify the duration of traffic lights on the main
roads in the city depending on the directions from where we observe the
main traffic movements. For instance, if, at a certain point in time, we
observe that the traffic flow on a certain road A is significantly
higher than in the crossing roads, then we may decide to extend, for
instance, for one hour, the duration of green lights on A (and,
consequently, extend the duration of red lights in the crossing
roads).\\
We want to analyze the daily traffic patterns and identify possible
optimizations in terms of one-way roads, traffic lights configuration,
and public transport schedule.\\
We want to collect information about the planning of events attracting
large crowds (e.g., important sport events, concerts, fairs) and define
event-specific configurations for traffic lights, roads and public
transport schedules.

\section{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Drivers: benefit from reduced waiting times and improved traffic flow.
  \item Citizens: benefit from lower air pollution and enhanced public transport.
  \item Urban Area Managers: responsible for optimizing city mobility and approving changes.
  \item Event Planners: coordinate with the system for efficient management of large events.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Human Actors}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Traffic Lights: get its state set from the EcoTraffic system for a determined period.
  \item Sensor Infrastructure: send sensor information to the EcoTraffic system via data bus.
  \item Public Transport Microservice: sends public transport schedules to the EcoTraffic system via function calls.
  \item News Channel: transmits information about city events to the EcoTraffic system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Cases}\label{sec:use-cases}
\subsection{Scenarios (to modify)}\label{subsec:scenarios}

\subsubsection{Traffic light duration adjustment}\label{subsubsec:traffic-light-duration}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  During peak traffic hours, vehicles take more than necessary to cross a
  particular intersection coming from a busy road, while the crossing
  road is less used.
\item
  The traffic system sensor measures crossing times and publishes them on the
  message bus.
\item
  EcoTraffic retrieves and stores the data in a database.
\item
  EcoTraffic analyzes the crossing times to detect imbalances in traffic flow.
\item
  If an imbalance is detected, EcoTraffic computes adjusted green light durations for the affected intersections.

\section{Architecture}
\subsection{Components diagram}

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/svg/ComponentDiagram.pdf}
There have been inserted multiple interfaces named "Database" for readability. Actually, there is only one database that is used by all the components.
Its structure is shown in the next diagram:\\
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/svg/ERDDiagram.pdf}

\subsection{Subsystems and components}

The EcoTrafficManagers subsystem includes the following components:


\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{ApacheKafkaCluster:} the component is based on a framework for
  the event-driven paradigm and it includes primitives to create event
  producers and consumers and a runtime infrastructure to handle event
  transfer. This component it's the one responsible for receiving the data
  from the sensors system and from the news channel and to distribute
  them to the right components, which will then process and analyze them.
  More information can be found at \url{https://kafka.apache.org/}.
\item
  \textbf{TrafficLightManager:} this component receives the data
  measured by the sensors system from the ApacheKafkaCluster and
  provides a method to analyze this data to find unbalanced traffic loads
  into a crossing, to compute the new time in which the green light is
  switched on to reduce traffic congestion, to store into the database
  of the system the data obtained from the ApacheKafkaCluster and to
  connect to the control system of the traffic lights to apply the right
  modifications.
\item
  \textbf{EventManager:} this component receives the event specification
  from the ApacheKafkaCluster after that the news channel has published
  them. This component provides methods to retrieve information (such
  as the event type, the date, the place and the expected attendance)
  and a method to call the TrafficPatternManager component to optimize
  the event configuration to reduce traffic load.
\item
  \textbf{TrafficPatternManager:} this component could be called by
  three events. The first is when the EventManager calls it to perform
  event-based optimization, in this case, the component queries the
  database to find similar events and the daily traffic patterns in the
  zone where the event takes place, then generate possible optimizations
  from this data and from the timetables obtained after the
  getScheduleByStreet() and the getScheduleByLine() calls to the
  microservice. The second is when the UrbanAreaManagerController asks
  for an optimization around a specific zone, in this case, the component
  queries the daily traffic patterns in the zone and the timetables and
  tries to optimize the traffic loads. The third takes place
  automatically ten minutes after midnight, in this case, the
  component queries the daily crossing time in all the crossings of the
  area and finds traffic patterns, after that, it tries to optimize in
  terms of one-way roads, traffic lights configuration, and public
  transport schedule.
\end{itemize}

The Dashboard subsystem includes the following components:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{CitizenDashboard:} this component shows to the citizen an
  interface from where it can be decided to see the daily reports or the
  yearly ones. After choosing, the component calls the CitizenController
  to get the reports. When the response arrives, the component shows to
  the user the reports.
\item
  \textbf{CitizenController:} this component receives the request from
  the citizen dashboard and then queries the database to satisfy the
  request. After, the data are elaborated and sent to the dashboard.
\item
  \textbf{UrbanAreaManagerDashboard:} this component shows the UAM an
  interface from where it can be decided if to see the pending
  suggestions or to ask the system to optimize all the configurations in
  a specific zone. If the first option is chosen, it calls the
  UrbanAreaManagerController to get the pending suggestions. When the
  response arrives, the component shows to the user the reports and
  waits till all the decisions are taken. When each decision is taken,
  the component sends the answer to the controller. If the second option
  is taken, the dashboard presents the zones in the area and waits for
  the UAM's decision, after it arrives the component sends to the
  controller the requests and waits for the answer, after this arrives
  it displays to the UAM the suggestions, when the decision is taken,
  the component sends the answer to the controller.
\item
  \textbf{UrbanAreaManagerController:} this component is responsible for
  managing the requests arriving from the dashboard and redirecting them
  either to the database if the UAM wants to see the pending suggestions
  or to the TrafficPatternManager if the UAM wants an optimization for a
  specific zone. After the responses arrive, the component sends them to
  the dashboard. If the answer is an optimization the component waits
  for the approval or the rejection and stores the decision.
\end{itemize}

Analyzing traffic patterns requires complex processing of historical and real-time data. &
Our architecture is designed to separate the concerns of data collection, processing, and presentation. The \texttt{TrafficPatternManager} is specialized in creating algorithms to identify common traffic patterns and propose optimizations, while the \texttt{TrafficLightManager} handles the actual traffic light adjustments. \\

A scalable and efficient communication system is required to handle high-frequency data from sensors and from the news channel. &
We decided to use the \texttt{ApacheKafkaCluster} to handle event-driven communication, allowing real-time and asynchronous data processing of a large volume requests. \\

The system must be able to provide adaptive responses to city events with a minimum latency. &
The \texttt{EventManager} component processes the event data and classifies the event based on the expected attendance. It then triggers the \texttt{TrafficPatternManager}, which will provide an appropriate optimization routine. \\

The system must be able to provide a user-friendly interface for both citizens and urban area managers. &
The \texttt{CitizenDashboard} and \texttt{UrbanAreaManagerDashboard} components are designed to provide intuitive interfaces for users to access reports and make decisions. The dashboards are separated from the core logic of the system to ensure modularity and maintainability. \\

Human stakeholders must be involved in taking decisions for critical changes. &
On the \texttt{UrbanAreaManagerDashboard} pop up suggestions for optimizations retrieved directly from the unified database by the \texttt{UrbanAreaManagerController}. The human manager then decides whether to accept or reject the suggestions. When a response is received, the system logs the decisions in the database for future reference. \\

Supporting future scalability and integration of additional sensors or data sources. &
We designed our architecture to be modular, allowing an extension of the sensor net or for new data sources. The \texttt{ApacheKafkaCluster} can easily integrate new actors, ensuring that the system can adapt to future needs without significant modifications. \\

The system must be able to handle data consistency and coherence during communication with external systems. &
We implemented a robust error handling and data validation mechanism in the \texttt{TrafficLightManager} and \texttt{TrafficPatternManager} components to ensure that only valid data is processed and stored. This helps maintain data integrity and coherence across the system. \\

The system must be able to report real-time updates to the citizens. &
The \texttt{CitizenDashboard} is designed to provide real-time updates on traffic optimizations and possible changes on viability. The system uses a push mechanism to notify citizens of significant changes, ensuring they are always informed. \\
